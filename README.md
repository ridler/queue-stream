# Motivation

This is an application I wrote to manage requests for my help in a computing lab that I was a TA for.  It proved to be a better alternative to people raising their hands and waiting form me to get to them.  This application provides a fair way to address people in a busy environment where they can't move about.

# Technology

This application is an integration of Express.js, Angular.js, and Socket.io.

# Running

`npm install`
`npm start`
